This file contains instructions on how to build a signed partner APK file.

The build assumes that Android SDK and PHP are present in the system, and works on Mac or Linux,
but not on Window.

The build will sign the APK file using the key store settings as (see ant.properties file):

key.store=${user.home}/.android/release.keystore
key.alias=releasekey
key.store.password=bama97
key.alias.password=bama97

If you need to use different settings, or whish to type passwords manually during the build, modify the 
ant.properties file accordingly.

To run the build, do:

cd <facebook_project_dir>
android update project --path .

cd <town_container_project_dir>
android update project --path .

These commands will generate local.propertis files under undroid and facebook projects.  You only 
need to run them once on your system.


Then, to actually run the build do

./build.php <partner_id> [-install]

or

./build.php -all

APK files generated by the build will be saved in <project_dir>/deploy directory.

The first command will create one APK file for a partner id specified.  The optional -install flag
can be used to deploy the signed application file on the default system local device or emulator, which
needs to be up and running before the build starts.

The second command will generate APK files for all partners.  This may take a while since there are about
100 partners out there for now.
